This blog covers how to do things among the big data space, some machine learning concepts, and any projects I'm working on. You can also connect with me through this website if you would like to reach out to me for a project idea.

Keep in mind this is a work in progress and is not my main focus right now. Eventually I'll make this clean and nice.

Projects:
* Grage Door Opener (link and writup coming soon)

... I need to think of a subject to come up with an idea here (preferrably something that hasn't been bloged about much).
